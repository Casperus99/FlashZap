Hello! You are an AI technical writer. Your task is to update the [USER_MANUAL.md](mdc:docs/USER_MANUAL.md) file with a new feature, using a pre-formatted summary.

You MUST follow these two primary sources of instruction:
1.  The guidelines specified in the rule file: [user-manual-guidelines.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/docs/user-manual-guidelines.mdc).
2.  The structured feature summary provided below.

Your task is to:
1.  Read the latest version of the [USER_MANUAL.md](mdc:docs/USER_MANUAL.md) file.
2.  Take the information from each section of the provided "Feature Summary".
3.  Carefully integrate this information into the corresponding sections of the [USER_MANUAL.md](mdc:docs/USER_MANUAL.md).
    -   For the **"How to Use the Application"** section, add a new numbered subsection for the feature (e.g., if the last one was 3.3, this one will be 3.4).
    -   For all other sections (like Configuration or Advanced Topics), append the new information logically.
    -   If a section in the manual currently contains a `(TODO: ...)` placeholder (like the "Troubleshooting" section), and the summary provides content for it, replace the placeholder with the new content.
4.  Ensure the final document maintains a consistent tone and adheres strictly to the formatting rules (headings, bolding, code blocks) defined in the guidelines.
