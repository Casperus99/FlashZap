# Workflow: Extend Task List from User Story

You are going to extend already created task list with proposed high-level files addition and modifications.

## Step 1: Analyze User Story
Read and analyze the provided user story file, including its acceptance criteria, and notes.

## Step 2: Read the Task List
Read the task list in the `/current-job/` directory.

## Step 3: Read the `src` rules
Read these rules: [project-structure-src.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/src/project-structure-src.mdc).

## Step 4: Analyze Required Files
After gathering all the context your job is to create a short note for every parent task. This note should specify which and where files should be created/modified to implement the task. And the note should specify method names which should be created/modified. It should also have short, high-level explaination what should the new function do or what should be changed. You musn't propose code here.

## Step 5: Add the Notes

Write the notes for every parent task and save the file.
